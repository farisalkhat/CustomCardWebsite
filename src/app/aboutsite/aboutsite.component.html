    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>The Attic is a concept and way of life started to create the optimal Yu-Gi-Oh experience in the eyes of a group who have somewhat lost their love for the modern game. What initially started as a night of fun creating cards transformed into a massive database of thousands of customs, from Normal monsters given effects to anime cards that never saw a release. Cards created by The Attic’s members range from monsters with slightly tweaked effects to increase their playability to massive overhauls and brand new effects with lengths that trump even modern era cards. </p>
    <p>The initial concept of a custom format that The Attic members attempted was to put the spotlight onto the many forgotten Normal Monsters from the card games early years. The rules were that monsters in your deck could only contain Normal monsters all of the same type and Spell/Trap cards which specified that type of monster in their text. After experimenting, the members started to create modest effects for the Normal Monsters, thus creating the first form of the Chegger’s Format. Initially, creating Spells and Traps was not a part of the mission statement, nor was modifying effects of existing monsters. But slowly, over time, The Attic’s members started to become ambitious, and eventually started to create massive amounts of cards, creating enough to comfortably build hundreds of decks of purely custom cards at a power level that was not too inflated and power crept as the modern game but was more dynamic than retro formats that people were playing. An interest in the power level of  GOAT and Edison format and love for Yu-Gi-Oh and its horribly designed monsters created the custom card format as it is today. </p>
    <p>The essential mission statement of the custom cards as they are now is to take cards from all eras of Yu-Gi-Oh and combine them all into one format where they are all nearly viable. Compared to the paper game, the custom cards have the advantage of not needing to be sold to eliminate the need for power and feature creep as well as the ability to be modified to ensure no card can dominate the game. While some members of The Attic got lost in the sauce and made many cards which were far too powerful, and also incorporated many new styles of cards such as XYZs despite it being the antithesis of the formats purpose, changes made to staple cards and the creation of many new staples created a game where no one strategy is superior and all styles of cards can be made viable.</p>
    <p>While the created cards and duels are all done on the website Dueling Book, deck construction and card management is done on the lovingly crafted Attic website, which you’re on right now. The Attic Website exists as an easy way to view all of The Attics cards and sort them easily because Dueling Book is a really bad website and doesn’t let us look through all of our cards easily because they are all from different creators. That’s it. Now go open some packs.</p>
